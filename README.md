# AI4MEDIA AUTH VISIT 

This repo contains all the stuff developed during the AI4Media collaboration between AUTH and CATEC.

It contains three main folders: 

* **airsim_dataset_generator**: It contains all the necessary tools for communicating with Airsim using Python as well as for generating trajectories or visualising them. This will simplify the task of generating datasets for computer vision.

* **project**: Contains the ROS nodes from the research carried out and developed in the AI4Media technical report.

* **unreal_wiki**: A simple wiki on how to install Unreal on Linux and integrate with Airsim.
